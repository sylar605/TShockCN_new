TShock supports automatic language detection based on your system regional settings. If you want to override this, set the `TSHOCK_LANGUAGE` environment variable to a different language, or pass the `-lang` command line argument to change the language.

If you can't load other languages, make sure that you still have a folder called `i18n` and that your language folder of choice contains a `.mo` file. If it does, those translations should load successfully if you override the language settings using `TSHOCK_LANGUAGE` or if you set your regional settings to the right language.

The base for the i18n system was built by Janet Blackquill ([@pontaoski](https://github.com/pontaoski)). A small donation in her honor was made to the [KDE project](https://kde.org/) as a thankyou for this work.

## Simplified Chinese (`zh_CN`)

We owe a very special thanks to our `zh_CN` translators. From the start of the project, we wanted `zh_CN` to be one of our best supported languages. Thank you to the following contributors of translations:
